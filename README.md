# MatlabScripts
Used for the FFT and FMR scripts
FFTmaster.m: Allows one to determine Fourier Intensity for variopus element sizes through differing directories. Asks the user for frequency range; outputing said range and then the user can choose the number of peaks to analyse. The input frequency range it then outputs 1D (Slices), 2D (Spatial) intensity plots along with 2D phase diagrams and the superposition of both.
FMRmaster.m: Allows the user to detail local FMR frequencies determined in said local coordiante system from a differing directory. Asks the user for biasing field strength. Process: (FC).FMRmaster -> (FC).calcDeflection (step can be skipped if done previously) -> OOMMF software pac kage used to detail B_eff_static, B_eff_inplane and B_eff_outplane .ovf files through archiving from OXSII command window -> (FC).calcDemagTensor() (which has a range of other options see script). This then outputs Nxx, Nyy, Nzz tensor components and Local Spatial FMR plots with slices.
